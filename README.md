## 🧪 What is Kuso Physics?

Kuso Physics challenges players with clever level design and realistic ball movement. Players use Shake Mode (via device or mouse movement) to influence the ball's trajectory and solve physics-based puzzles.

## 🚀 Getting Started (for Developers)

This is a self-hostable game built with Next.js and uses modern web technologies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KusoGames/Kuso-Physics.git
cd Kuso-Physics
npm install
npm run dev
````

This will set up a local development environment.

You can then access the game at `http://localhost:3000`.
